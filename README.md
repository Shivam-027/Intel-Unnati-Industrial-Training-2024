# Intel-Unnati-Industrial-Training-2024

This repository contains the code and documentation for our project submitted for the Unnati Intel Industrial Training Program 2024. The project aims to demonstrate running GenAI on Intel AI Laptops and performing simple LLM inference on CPU. Additionally, it covers the fine-tuning of LLM models using Intel® OpenVINO™.

## Key Features:
- **GenAI on Intel AI Laptops**: Showcases the ability to run generative models efficiently on Intel hardware.
- **LLM Inference on CPU**: Performs inference tasks using large language models directly on the CPU, optimizing performance without requiring a GPU.
- **Fine-tuning with Intel® OpenVINO™**: Enhances LLM models through fine-tuning using Intel’s OpenVINO toolkit to achieve faster inference and greater efficiency.

## Team Members:
- **Tanishk Soni**
- **Shivam Saini**
- **Bhoomi Taneja**
